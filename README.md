# IBM® Decision Optimization Tutorials for Python (DOcplex)

Welcome to the IBM® Decision Optimization Tutorials.
Licensed under the Apache License v2.0.

With these tutorials, you will learn the concepts of Mathematical Optimization.

This library is composed of 2 Jupyter notebooks:

* Linear Programming discovery
* Beyond Linear Programming

You just need to import them in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

To be able to run those notebooks successfully, you will need to have any of the following options:
- be in IBM DataScience Experience Desktop or Local editions.
- be in IBM DataScience Experience Cloud edition with a subscription to IBM Decision Optimization on Cloud service (30 days free offer available)
- be on your machine with an installation CPLEX Optimization Studio
- be on your machine with a subscription to IBM Decision Optimization on Cloud service (30 days free offer available)

## Get your IBM® Decision Optimization on Cloud API key

Optionally, you can run your optimization in the cloud with the IBM
Decision Optimization on Cloud service.
   
- Register for the DOcplexcloud free trial and use it free for 30 days. See [Free trial](https://developer.ibm.com/docloud/try-docloud-free).
 
- Get your API key
    With your free trial, you can generate a key to access the DOcplexcloud API. 
    Visit the [Get API key & base URL](http://developer.ibm.com/docloud/docs/api-key) page to generate the key once you've registered. 
    This page also contains the base URL you must use for DOcplexcloud.
    
- Copy/paste your API key and service URL where appropriate in the examples to be able to run them, or have a look at *Setting up an optimization engine* section of the documentation

## Get your IBM® ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio edition

- You can get a free [Community Edition](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/websphere/products/optimization/cplex-studio-community-edition)
 of CPLEX Optimization Studio, with limited solving capabilities in term of problem size.

- Faculty members, research professionals at accredited institutions can get access to an unlimited version of CPLEX through the
 [IBM® Academic Initiative](http://www-304.ibm.com/ibm/university/academic/pub/page/ban_ilog_programming).
